# Chapter 3 – Hello, little turtles!

## 🐢 Exercises Covered
- Drawing polygons (triangle, square, hexagon, octagon)
- Drunk Pirate random path simulation
- Clock face & star patterns

## 🧠 What I Learned
- Using `for` loops to repeat drawing steps.
- Applying modular arithmetic (`% 360`) to calculate angles.
- Debugging through visual feedback (penup, pendown, heading).

## 💡 Reflection
The turtle module helped me visualize loops and logic flow.
It made abstract code feel tangible — a great bridge to understanding geometry and iteration.
