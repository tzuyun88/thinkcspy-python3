# How to Think Like a Computer Scientist (Python 3)

This repository documents my learning process while studying  
**"How to Think Like a Computer Scientist – Learning with Python 3"**.  

## Learning Goals
- Strengthen logical and computational thinking
- Practice iteration, conditionals, and functions
- Visualize algorithms using the `turtle` graphics module

## Featured Exercises
- Drunk Pirate Simulation – simulate random walks using loops and modular arithmetic  
- Polygon Drawer – draw regular shapes (triangle, hexagon, octagon)  
- Clock Face – turtle-based circular geometry

## Structure
Each folder corresponds to a chapter:
